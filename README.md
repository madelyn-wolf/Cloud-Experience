## Repository Overview

This repository contains academic cloud computing work completed as part of the **IFT 320: Managing the Cloud** course at Arizona State University. The materials demonstrate hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure design, AWS service deployment, cloud cost optimization, and provider comparison.

The repository is organized into a final project and additional standalone assignments.

## Final Project

The final project consists of a **technical paper and an accompanying hands-on lab**, which together demonstrate end-to-end cloud planning, deployment, and validation.

### Final Project Paper
The paper focuses on migrating an on-premises infrastructure to AWS, including:
- Infrastructure requirement analysis
- EC2 instance selection and sizing
- Storage planning using Amazon S3 and EBS
- Cost optimization using Reserved Instances and Savings Plans
- Cloud migration strategy and phased implementation planning
- Demonstrated a 43% reduction in overall expenses 

### Final Project Lab
The lab validates the proposed cloud design through hands-on AWS deployment, including:
- EC2 instance provisioning in AWS Academy Learner Lab
- Security group configuration
- Storage attachment and formatting
- IIS installation and validation
- Application Load Balancer configuration
- Target group health checks
- Route 53 DNS configuration
- CloudWatch monitoring and metrics analysis

## Additional Assignments

### Cloud Economics Analysis
This assignment evaluates total cost of ownership (TCO) between traditional on-premises infrastructure and cloud-based environments, factoring in:
- Hardware acquisition costs
- Energy consumption
- Licensing
- Maintenance and staffing
- Long-term scalability considerations
- Demonstrated a savings of $205,129.72 for Server Farm 1

### Cloud Provider Comparison
This assignment compares AWS, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud across:
- Compute, storage, and database services
- IAM and networking costs
- Scalability and ecosystem maturity
- Suitability for small, mid-sized, and enterprise workloads
